# Agent guide

This file is the authoritative entry point for humans and coding agents. Read it before changing code.

## Product and architecture

`dsh-github-copilot` is a companion to the controlled DSH Desktop `0.1.1-rc.2` Core baseline and DSH `0.1.2-rc.1`. It does not own a general Copilot chat adapter. DSH's built-in `llm-pi-ai` mount owns the GitHub Copilot provider, catalog, OAuth method and grant format, token exchange, refresh, and normal model transport.

This repository owns six narrow surfaces:

1. A conditional authorization-service bootstrap plus Host controller that joins DSH authorization, credentials, and settings.
2. A Client Models provider-card contribution and Client-safe Remote descriptors.
3. Strict JSON normalization of pi-ai's provider-owned Copilot OAuth grant.
4. Reference-free creation of a missing `llm-pi-ai.providers.github-copilot` profile plus leaf-only reconciliation of existing profiles.
5. Direct provider-hosted search using the same Host-side credential lifecycle.
6. Provider-scoped tool-schema compatibility for Copilot payload behaviors; Core remains the tool and execution owner.

## File map

- `src/index.ts`: authorization bootstrap, dependency-gated Host entry, settings registration, listener, and `ctx.web` provider composition.
- `src/authorization-controller.ts`: sign-in/status/sign-out and route mutation.
- `src/copilot-grant.ts`, `src/copilot-auth.ts`: strict grant normalization and narrow pi-ai `CredentialStore` adapter over `llm-pi-ai/github-copilot`.
- `src/client.ts`: `settings.models.provider-card` UI keyed by `llm-pi-ai`.
- `src/remote.ts`: Typert Remote contribution. Never add credential payloads here.
- `src/current-provider.ts`: selected DSH route plus installed pi-ai catalog facts.
- `src/tool-schema-compat.ts`: Copilot-only prompt-assembly filter for unusable escalation arguments and action-specific Goal update schemas.
- `src/plan.ts`: Copilot-only, fail-closed hosted-search candidate lifecycle.
- `src/probe.ts`: bounded native-search capability proof.
- `src/wire.ts`, `src/wire-anthropic.ts`: inline hosted-search streaming.
- `src/traditional-search.ts`: `github-copilot-hosted` `ctx.web` provider.
- `src/serialize.ts`, `src/sse.ts`, `src/failure.ts`: protocol conversion and bounded error handling.
- `tests/`: unit and integration evidence; mirror the source area being changed.
- `deployment-baseline.json`: declared machine-readable compatibility and capability evidence inventory.
- `scripts/verify-deployment-baseline.mjs`: invariant drift gate.
- `lib/`: generated release output; never edit it.

## Non-negotiable invariants

- Do not add a second general Copilot LLM adapter or model catalog.
- Do not require or silently support `copilot2api`, an external gateway, a pasted GitHub token, a placeholder key, or `dsh-web-search-provider`.
- The credential record key is `llm-pi-ai/github-copilot`.
- OAuth credential payloads stay Host-only. Client Remote methods may expose status, notices, and errors only.
- Refresh must run through pi-ai `Models.getAuth()` and DSH `credentials.modifyRecord()`.
- Copilot OAuth grant writes must rebuild only pi-ai's documented provider fields as a fresh plain JSON object; unrelated extension values never reach DSH credential storage.
- Settings changes are path-level. Never replace the whole `llm-pi-ai` section or unrelated provider profiles.
- Sign-out deletes only the Copilot credential record and keeps route settings.
- Hosted search only serves the selected `github-copilot` route for an account-available model and a native search protocol. The default `probe: true` path requires successful capability proof; `probe: false` is an explicit trust override, not an implicit fallback.
- Misconfiguration and API drift fail loudly with a named missing seam. Do not fall back to process-local secrets or implicit machine state.
- Host, Client, and Remote package entries must stay independently buildable and exported.
- The package must self-provide authorization when Core omits it, reuse an existing service without duplicate registration, and never activate the integration body before authorization is available.

## Supported DSH seams

The supported upstream baselines are:

- Desktop `0.1.1-rc.2` with controlled Core commit `a772dbbde82780bff2b9394427e9f0a24cafa1d5`
  on `cloga-pi-ai-model-api`, based on tag commit `b150a551b8d465e31e418e1b2eaf5e79bbb7d28e`.
- Tag `dsh-v0.1.2-rc.1`, commit `a66e4702047846cdaa10c66c9d3df3951f5ea70d`.

- Models UI: rc.1 uses `settings.models.provider-card`, keyed by settings namespace `llm-pi-ai`; rc.2 falls back to a dedicated `settings.section`.
- Authorization flow key: `llm-pi-ai/github-copilot`.
- Authorization service: rc.1 Core provides it; the rc.2 web/headless profiles rely on this package's runtime dependency and conditional bootstrap.
- Credentials: use record description/read/modify/delete APIs on the Host. Never read records in the browser.
- Copilot grant schema: `type: oauth`, non-empty `refresh`/`access`, finite `expires`, optional non-empty `enterpriseUrl`, and optional deduplicated non-empty-string `availableModelIds`.
- Settings: create the provider through a path operation at `providers.github-copilot`.
- Per-model API: materialize each account model as `{ id, api }`; never flatten a mixed route to route-level connection fields.
- Route activation: the dormant `llm-pi-ai` mount observes the profile and registers the route.
- Client activation: package metadata injects DSH remotes and Models UI; `./client` mounts `./remote`.
- Provider headers: rc.1 validates configured headers through Fetch and reuses Host-owned headers during model discovery.
- Remote results: all authorization methods share the Zod v4 `GitHubCopilotAuthorizationView` strict codec required by rc.2 and accepted by rc.1.

When upgrading DSH or pi-ai, inspect the exact tagged public exports and update the baseline, compatibility guard, tests, and docs together.

## Code and documentation conventions

- TypeScript is strict, ESM, and English-only for code, comments, test names, and `README.md`.
- `README.zh.md` is the Chinese user guide and should match the English product contract.
- Prefer existing helpers and narrow interfaces over casts or broad catches.
- Provider/network errors must not leak credentials or raw sensitive response bodies.
- Do not commit generated archives, temporary files, `.env` files, tokens, or local credentials.
- Keep design rationale in code/docs that enforce it; do not add empty templates or duplicate policy documents.

## Distribution and release invariants

- GitHub Releases are the only distribution channel; `package.json` stays private and npm publishing must not return.
- User-facing install commands must include the required DSH `--profile` option and derive the versioned Release URL from `package.json`.
- Package version, deployment-baseline version, README URLs, and the annotated `v<version>` tag must agree.
- The Release workflow must run the complete gate, pack the versioned tarball, publish `SHA256SUMS`, and create the Release only after every preceding step succeeds.
- Release tags must never move or be reused. Repository tag rules and immutable-release settings enforce this for new releases.

## Installation-agent PowerShell practice

Installation agents using the DSH `pwsh` tool must follow these rules:

- Initial `pwsh` calls omit `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` entirely.
- When approval prompts are disabled, never include either field.
- When the current sandbox mode is `danger-full-access`, never request escalation.
- Use both fields only once, when retrying the exact same command after a real sandbox denial, approval is available, and the target mode is strictly wider than the current mode.
- Omit the keys rather than sending `null`, empty strings, or the current sandbox mode.

The plugin keeps its managed Copilot route on ordinary JSON-schema tool calling and removes `sandbox_permissions` plus `justification` only from tool schemas assembled for the `github-copilot` provider. Optional schema semantics alone do not stop these models from emitting invalid escalation requests. Other providers retain the native one-shot escalation surface; Copilot sessions must choose sufficient standing permissions before a call that needs wider access. The rules above remain agent-side practice, and the plugin does not rewrite user-global agent instructions.

## Mechanical verification

Run from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm verify:baseline
pnpm build
pnpm verify:package
pnpm pack --pack-destination artifacts
```

`pnpm verify` is the normal complete gate. Use a focused `vitest run <files...>` while iterating, then run the complete gate before commit. CI runs frozen install, `pnpm verify`, and package creation on Windows and Linux.

The rc.2 development dependencies are the Desktop compiler and runtime baseline. CI separately checks out the exact rc.2 and rc.1 upstream commits and runs `pnpm verify:upstream -- dsh-upstream` to verify every public seam this plugin consumes.

## Changing capabilities

1. Identify the owning seam above; do not duplicate an upstream owner.
2. Add or update focused tests before changing deployment claims.
3. Update both READMEs when user behavior, setup, migration, or boundaries change.
4. Update `deployment-baseline.json` and its verifier for a new required capability or export.
5. Build before package smoke; never hand-edit `lib/`.

## Issue, branch, and PR workflow

- Every change starts from a tracking issue.
- Work on a feature branch; never commit directly to `main`.
- Commit messages reference the issue and include the repository-required co-author trailer.
- Run the complete verification gate before pushing.
- Push the feature branch and open a PR targeting the resolved default branch with `Fixes #<issue>`.
- Do not merge unless explicitly requested.

GitHub operations must use the repository owner's intended authenticated identity. Never print tokens or embed them in commands.
